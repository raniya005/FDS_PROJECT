 Healthcare Prediction
 This project uses a healthcare dataset with details such as patient age, gender, medical condition, billing amount, and admission type. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likely test result a patient may receive.
 DATASET NAME: Healthcare Dataset
 ABOUT DATASET:
-The dataset consists of 10,000 records, each representing a synthetic patient healthcare record.
-It includes various attributes, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, admission details, and more.
DATASET OVERVIEW:
Rows: 55,500
Columns: 15
Columns include: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Billing Amount, Admission Type, Test Results, etc.
